# Budi Helper

This web app is created to help budi choose which sofa to buy.  
This app will show Budi a 1 type of sofa that is similar to "Sofa 2 dudukan Vienna" (the one that he actually wanted but sadly it's not in stock)  
Sadly I don't have the time to sort it algorithmically, so I sort it manually instead (The app will iterate the Sofa's according to it's id in the database), but I hope Budi will find this useful.

Stacks: Django(monolith) & sqlite(for local) & postgresql(heroku)
